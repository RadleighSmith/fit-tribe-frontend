## Code Validation

### JavaScript Validation

### ESLint Error Fixes

In our project, we leveraged [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to maintain code quality and consistency throughout our JavaScript and React (JSX) codebase. ESLint helped us identify potential errors and deviations from our coding standards, ensuring our code remained clean and maintainable. By configuring ESLint with specific rules, we tailored it to meet our project's requirements and coding style.

One of the most beneficial features we utilized was the --fix command. By running eslint --fix src/**/*.{js,jsx}, we automatically corrected numerous common formatting and syntactical errors, such as incorrect quotation marks, missing semicolons, and inconsistent spacing. This automated fixing process significantly reduced the time and effort required to address these issues manually, allowing our development team to focus on more complex and critical aspects of the project.

However, there were some errors that could not be fixed automatically using the --fix command. These required manual intervention to ensure compliance with our coding standards. Below is a table summarizing the errors that were manually fixed:

## Accessibility Testing

**Lighthouse**

We used [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview), an open-source, automated tool, to perform a comprehensive audit of our web pages. Lighthouse evaluates various aspects of web accessibility based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). By running a Lighthouse audit, it can identify and address issues such as missing alt text for images, insufficient color contrast, and keyboard navigation problems. The tool provided actionable insights and recommendations for each identified issue, enabling us to enhance the accessibility of our platform. Through Lighthouse, we ensured that our website meets accessibility standards and delivers a better user experience for all users, including those with disabilities.

The low scores on Best Practices for the Create and Edit pages are primarily due to the use of deprecated APIs. Specifically, DOM Mutation Events, including `DOMSubtreeModified`, `DOMNodeInserted`, `DOMNodeRemoved`, `DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument`, `DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument`, and `DOMCharacterDataModified`, are deprecated and will be removed in future versions of Chrome. We believe this issue is caused by Quill, the rich text editor. We have reached out to Quill for guidance on this matter and will implement a fix in the next iteration or replace the rich text editor if necessary. Additionally, the Best Practices scores have been affected by the use of third-party cookies. Future versions of Chrome will no longer support third-party cookies, which are used by some of our integrations, such as Cloudinary for image hosting and Heroku for backend services. Unfortunately, we cannot resolve these issues immediately due to the dependencies on third-party services, but we are monitoring updates and will address them as soon as possible.

Moreover, the accessibility scores for these pages have been impacted by Quill's buttons not providing accessible names. We are limited in our ability to modify Quill's internal structure but are exploring alternative editors that comply better with accessibility standards.

Performance improvements are also on our roadmap for the next iteration. We plan to implement an on-demand image resizer and a loading spinner to ensure that the entire document has loaded before being displayed to the user. This will enhance the overall user experience by reducing load times and providing visual feedback during content loading. We are committed to continuously improving our site's performance and accessibility to offer the best possible user experience.

**WAVE Testing**

To ensure accessibility compliance, we utilized the WAVE tool to evaluate the accessibility of our web pages. The WAVE tool is a robust platform that identifies accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) errors on web pages.

The majority of our pages passed the WAVE testing with no errors. However, some pages, specifically the create and edit pages, showed 12 errors. These errors are primarily due to missing form labels and empty buttons, which stem from the Quill rich text editor used on these pages. Quill does not provide accessible names for its buttons, resulting in these accessibility issues.

While we have passed the accessibility standards on most pages, we acknowledge the need to address the shortcomings associated with Quill. In future iterations, we plan to either find a solution to make Quill's buttons accessible or replace Quill with a different rich text editor that complies with accessibility standards. This will ensure that all our pages meet the highest accessibility requirements, providing a better user experience for everyone.

Below are the results:

| Page Name            | WAVE Testing Status | Errors |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Homepage (Logged out) | PASS                | 0      |
| Homepage (Logged In)  | PASS                | 0      |

| Group Detail         | PASS                | 0      |

| Event Edit           | FAIL                | 12     |
| Event Detail         | PASS                | 0      |

**Note:** The failures on the create and edit pages are due to 12 errors related to missing form labels and empty buttons. This issue is caused by the Quill rich text editor, which does not provide accessible names on their buttons. Efforts will be made to address this in future iterations, either by applying fixes or by choosing a different rich text editor.

**Note:** The failure on Safari browsers (both mobile and desktop) is due to a known issue related to cross-site tracking and cookies. This issue arises because the project is deployed in separate frontend and backend repositories/URLs. If time permits, we will consider combining both backend and frontend under one terminal to resolve this issue.

### Device Testing

- **iPhone 13:**
  - Tested the entire platform on Safari. Encountered issues with staying logged in due to cross-site tracking and cookies.
- **Windows PC:**
  - Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. All tests passed successfully.
- **iPad Air:**
  - Tested on Safari and Chrome. Safari experienced similar issues as on the iPhone 13 due to cross-site tracking and cookies. Chrome tests passed.
- **MacBook Pro:**
  - Tested on Safari and Chrome. Safari experienced similar issues as on the iPhone 13 due to cross-site tracking and cookies. Chrome tests passed.

These tests highlight the need for improvements in handling cross-site tracking and cookies, especially for Safari users. Additionally, the performance on various devices will be enhanced in future iterations by implementing on-demand image resizing and a loading spinner to ensure the entire document loads before being displayed to the user.
