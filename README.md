## Planning

### The Strategy Plane

#### Why We Are Building the Project:

The primary motivation behind this project is to create a centralized platform for fitness enthusiasts to connect, share, and support each other in their fitness journeys. Current fitness resources are fragmented across various platforms, making it challenging for users to find comprehensive information and engage with a supportive community. By addressing these issues, we aim to provide a safe, privacy-focused space for users to achieve their fitness goals.

#### Product Description:

Our fitness social media site is designed to be a comprehensive platform where users can create accounts, log in, and share their fitness experiences through workout posts, blogs, and regular updates. Users can follow other members, like and comment on posts, view profiles, and join groups centered around specific fitness interests. The platform is built with user safety in mind, incorporating robust privacy settings and age verification to ensure all members are over the age of 18.

#### Target Audience:

Our target audience includes:
- Adults aged over 18.
- Fitness enthusiasts looking for a community to share and gain knowledge.
- Gym-goers seeking workout inspiration and tips.
- Personal trainers and fitness professionals wanting to connect with clients and peers.
- Nutritionists interested in sharing and learning about diet and fitness.
- Health-conscious individuals aiming to improve their lifestyle.
- Athletes seeking specialized fitness content and community support.

#### Problem Statement:

There is currently a lack of centralized platforms where fitness enthusiasts can connect, share, and support each other while ensuring their privacy and safety. This fragmentation makes it difficult for users to find reliable fitness information and engage with a cohesive community.

#### Project Aim:

Our aim is to develop a user-friendly fitness social media platform that provides a centralized space for users to share workout routines, blogs, and regular posts, connect with like-minded individuals, and participate in supportive communities. We are committed to creating an environment where users can interact freely, confident in the knowledge that their privacy is protected and all users are over the age of 18. Through this, we hope to empower users to achieve their fitness goals in a safe and supportive online community.
By focusing on these aspects within the strategy plane, we ensure that our project is aligned with user needs and our product objectives, setting a strong foundation for the subsequent stages of development.
